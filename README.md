Bike or not

This allows wimpy cyclists to work out whether to take their bike or not on their regular commute, by looking at the BBC weather forecast.
It looks at the weather conditions and temperature during the commute times, and works out whether you should take your bike or not.

Current state:
Output is for debug. Query parameters work

Future work:
Allow others to store their own preferences on their browser.
Better display (currently displays actual temperature and weather for debugging)
API?
Hardware integration, e.g. Raspberry Pi and LEDs.
Different weather provider?

Limitations:
UK only
Once you've configured the times you can't easily change them. If you want to know a different time, just look up the forecast.
