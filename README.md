Bike or not

This allows wimpy cyclists to work out whether to take their bike or not on their regular commute, by looking at the BBC weather forecast.
It looks at the weather conditions and temperature during the commute times, and works out whether you should take your bike or not.

Current state:
Hard coded for my work location and my preferences.

Future work:
Allow others to store their own preferences on their browser.
Better display (currently displays actual temperature and weather for debugging)
API?
Hardware integration, e.g. Raspberry Pi and LEDs.
Different weather provider?

Limitations:
UK only
3 hour timeslots only (probably because my server is't in the UK so the BBC provides an inferior service to foreigners, which is fair enough seeing as this is funded by my license fee.
Once you've configured the times you can't easily change them. If you want to know a different time, just look up the forecast.
